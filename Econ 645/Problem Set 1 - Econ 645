a. On average, do women with more than two children work less than women with two children? 
Explain using the regression results.  

Yes; the coefficient is negative. Pvalue = 0.  

b. Now add controls for race and age of the mother.  */

/* Interpret the coefficient on morekids.

After adding controls, the coefficient becomes larger in absolute value and the tscore
increases. The standard error decreases somewhat but not by much. */

/*9. Why is OLS inappropriate for estimating the causal effect of fertility (morekids) on labor supply
(weeksm1)

Because morekids may be endogenous in the model and correlated with the error term.

same gender (samesex) an instrument for morekids
a. Estimate a first stage regression of morekids on samesex (as well as the other regressors we added in part (3).

/*
b. Explain why samesex is a valid instrument.

	Samesex is a valid instrument for morekids because it is correlated to morekids and not with the error.

c. Is samesex a weak or strong instrument? */

b. Compare the coefficient on xhat to the one on morekids from the OLS regression.
It is less negative.

ivregress.
