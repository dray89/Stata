> /* Question 4) Regression Discontinuity
> 
> (a) What are the potential biases of using OLS?
> 
> Selection bias: Although we understand the observable characteristics that determined
> treatment assignment (pre-program rural income per capita), there may be unobserved
> characteristics determining income.
> 
> Measurement Error: Measurement error may not be randomized throughout the treatment
> and control groups, thus leading to bias. For example, some income information may be
> inaccurate, subject to misreporting.
> 
> (b) Discuss how you can use the nature of the implementation of China’s 8-7 Plan 
> to design a regression discontinuity evaluation of the above.
> What is the running variable, and where is the discontinuity? 
> 
> Income is the running variable determining treatment at an arbitrary cutoff point.
> Although selection and measurement error may arise under a variety of circumstances
> including prior knowledge of the government's stimulas plan leading to manipulation 
> of the running variable, the running variable can still be used as an IV for treatment
> as long as it meets the exclusion assumption that it is only related to the outcome 
> variable through its relationship with treatment, it is exogenous and uncorrelated with
> the error term, and it is relevant, correlated with treatment. The discontinuity
> is at the cutoff point, the poverty line. The discontinuity separates counties above
> and below the poverty line, those which are eligible for treatment, and those which are not.
> 
> (c) What does the following graph tell you about about how reasonable this strategy is? 
> What additional assumptions must be made for the regression discontinuity strategy to be valid
> ?
> 
> There is a discontinuity in poor county status from .2 to over .4. Heterogenous treatment
> effects may make this significant if counties which receive treatment underrepresented
> income to be assigned into the treatment group. These counties may have lower marginal
> effects from treatment than the other counties, meaning that income directly effects
> treatment outcome around the cutoff and assignment is no longer as good as random.
> 
> The assumptions are that there must be no perfect manipulation of the running variable, 
> and the running variable must be exogenous, relevant, and must not directly influence
> treatment except through its effect on treatment assignment.
> 
>  Treatment Assignment needs to be random around the cutoff variable.If observations are able t
> o 
>  perfectly manipulate the running variable to receive treatment or if obs can refuse 
>  treatment once assigned, the treatment and control groups would be contaminated by noncomplie
> rs.
> In other words, those randomly assigned to treatment must receive treatment and 
> those randomly assigned to the control group must not receive treatment.
> 
> (d)
>  Your research assistant creates the following graph plotting the ﬁtted relationship
>  between log income growth and pre-program log income per capita, both to the left and 
>  to the right of the cutoﬀ. Explain what aspects of the graph describe the treatment 
>  eﬀect of the 8-7 Plan.
> 
>  The observations above the poverty level experienced lower change in log income per
>  capita than the observations below the poverty line. The vertical distance at the cutoff
>  represents the treatment effect of the plan which is approximately the vertical distance
>  between the point just below .75 and around .62. 
>  
>  (e) Explain what a researcher can do to ensure that any eﬀects along the discontinuity 
>  is due to the policy, and not something else that changes at that same cutoﬀ. What does the 
>  following ﬁgure tell you about whether or not this concern applies in this context?
> 
>  The demographics of the poor counties and the rich counties at the cutoff vary with the runni
> ng variable.
> Thus, we are concerned about heterogenous treatment effects in missing 
>  explanatory variables in the regression for which need to be controlled.
>  
>  The figures describe different demographic distributions between treatment and control groups
> .
>  Specifically, as poverty increases, minority count increases and the populations become less 
>  educated, and overall, more impoverished counties are more likely to have a stronger 
>  revolutionary base than higher income counties. If the data was as good as random, 
>  the demographics at the cutoff would be similar, but in this case they are not.
